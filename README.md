# TEE-FL + 0g PoC

This is the first Proof-of-Concept implementation of Trusted Federated Learning (TEE-FL) using 0g's Galileo stack. The goal is to simulate a basic federated job lifecycle that integrates 0g’s on-chain compute tracking and decentralized storage services.

## Objectives

- Build a minimal compute job manager smart contract
- Deploy and interact with it on the 0g Galileo testnet
- Upload sample model and input data to 0g Storage
- Simulate reward-based job completion using hashes
