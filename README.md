\# TEE-FL + 0g PoC



This is the first Proof-of-Concept implementation of Trusted Federated Learning (TEE-FL) using 0g's Galileo stack. The goal is to simulate a basic federated job lifecycle that integrates 0g’s on-chain compute tracking and decentralized storage services.



\## Objectives



\- Build a minimal compute job manager smart contract

\- Deploy and interact with it on the 0g Galileo testnet

\- Upload sample model and input data to 0g Storage

\- Simulate reward-based job completion using hashes



---



\## Stack



\- Solidity + Hardhat (0.8.19)

\- Node.js (v22.16.0)

\- 0g Galileo testnet (EVM-compatible)

\- `@0glabs/0g-ts-sdk` for storage

\- TypeScript for 0g file upload

\- Windows (Dev Environment)



---



\## Smart Contract: `FLAIComputeJobs.sol`



Tracks compute jobs off-chain with on-chain references and rewards.
