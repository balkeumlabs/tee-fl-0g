| Task | % complete then | % complete now | Notes (why this score) |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Repo bootstrap & installs | 70 | 100 | npm ci was blocked by lock drift; fixed with lock-only update; clean install reproducible. |
| Hardhat config & compile | 30 | 100 | New minimal hardhat.galileo.js; .env wiring; contracts compile clean. |
| Contracts (AccessRegistry, EpochManager) | 50 | 100 | Sources compile; deployed; core events and getters exercised. |
| Deploy to Galileo | 0 | 100 | Deployed both contracts; addresses saved in .addresses.json. |
| Epoch lifecycle (start/submit/read) | 20 | 100 | Started epochs 1–3; submitted updates; event-based readers in place. |
| Event-based update indexer | 0 | 100 | read_update_raw.js reconstructs updates from UpdateSubmitted logs. |
| Scoring root (compute + post) | 0 | 100 | Deterministic dummy scoring + Merkle root; postScoresRoot on-chain for epochs 1–2. |
| Aggregation & publish (FedAvg) | 10 | 100 | FedAvg script; aggregated JSON + SHA-256; publishModel set; verified on-chain. |
| Access control gating (off-chain) | 0 | 80 | submit_update_checked_raw.js enforces AccessRegistry.isProviderApproved; demo grant→submit flow; not yet used everywhere. |
| Round orchestrator | 0 | 80 | round_controller.ps1 runs end-to-end (start → grant → N submits → scoresRoot → publish → verify). |
| 0G Storage integration (real CIDs) | 70 | 70 | Uploader exists and was previously verified; current demo uses simulated CIDs; wiring into submit/publish still pending. |
| Data encryption before upload | 20 | 20 | Pattern defined in plan; encryption not yet enforced in scripts. |
| TEE simulation + attestation placeholders | 20 | 30 | Local-only flow plus scores root and gating improve the skeleton; no real RA flow yet. |
| TEE scoring service (real) | 0 | 0 | Presently a dummy scorer; no enclave or RA verification yet. |
| TEE aggregation service (real) | 0 | 0 | Aggregation runs off-chain (Node), not in TEE; no attestation. |
| Inference via 0G Service Marketplace | 0 | 0 | Not started; pending model hosting + marketplace SDK alignment. |
| Payments/rewards distribution | 0 | 0 | Not implemented; requires additional on-chain logic. |
| Governance/SubDAO registries | 0 | 0 | Not implemented; part of control plane roadmap. |
| CI/CD + smoke tests | 0 | 10 | Scripts are deterministic; no GH Actions yet; add a basic workflow next. |
| Documentation (README + Report) | 60 | 60 | Needs an immediate delta PR to capture today’s working flow and scripts. |
