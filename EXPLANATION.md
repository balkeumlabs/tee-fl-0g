# TEE-FL-0G System Testing Explanation

## What is this system?

This is a **Federated Learning system** built on the 0G blockchain that allows multiple parties to train a shared AI model without sharing their private data. Think of it like a group of people working together to solve a puzzle, but each person keeps their piece of the puzzle private while still contributing to the final solution.

**Key Components:**
- **Smart Contracts**: Control who can participate and manage training rounds
- **0G Storage**: Stores encrypted model updates and data
- **TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)**: Secure computing environment that processes data without exposing it
- **Encryption**: Protects data privacy using advanced cryptographic methods

## What We Tested and How

### 1. Wallet and Money Test
**What we did:** Connected our wallet to the 0G network and checked if we had enough tokens to pay for transactions.

**How we tested:**
```bash
node scripts/check_balance.js
```

**Output:**
```
Wallet address: 0x9Ed57870379e28E32cb627bE365745dc184950dF
Balance: 5.0 0G
✅ Wallet has funds - ready for testing!
```

**Result:** ✅ **SUCCESS** - Wallet connected and funded with 5.0 0G tokens

### 2. Smart Contract Deployment
**What we did:** Deployed two smart contracts to the 0G blockchain:
- **AccessRegistry**: Controls who can participate in training
- **EpochManager**: Manages training rounds and model updates

**How we tested:**
```bash
node scripts/deploy_access_raw.js
node scripts/deploy_epoch_raw.js
```

**Output:**
```
// Deployer: 0x9Ed57870379e28E32cb627bE365745dc184950dF

❌ Upload failed: uploader.upload is not a function
```

**Result:** ❌ **PARTIAL SUCCESS** - Framework ready, but uploads failing due to SDK issues

## Data Flow - How It Works

### Step 1: Setup Phase
```
1. Deploy smart contracts on 0G blockchain
2. Grant access to participants (data owners)
3. Set up storage for encrypted model files
4. Configure TEE environment for secure processing
```

### Step 2: Training Round
```
1. Participants train models locally on their private data
2. They encrypt their model updates using X25519 + XChaCha20-Poly1305
3. Upload encrypted updates to 0G Storage (get CIDs)
4. Submit CIDs and hashes to smart contracts
5. TEE processes encrypted updates securely
6. System aggregates updates using FedAvg algorithm
7. New global model is created and encrypted
8. Model hash is stored on blockchain for verification
```

### Step 3: Verification and Rewards
```
1. System verifies model integrity using SHA-256 hashes
2. Participants get rewards for their contributions
3. New training round begins with updated global model
4. Process repeats for continuous learning
```
